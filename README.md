# Performance Instrumentation Tool

## Overview
The Performance Instrumentation Tool is a Java-based instrumentation utility that allows developers to monitor the execution time of methods and code blocks within their applications, identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize their code accordingly.

## Features
- **Timing Control**: Start and stop timing around code blocks to measure execution duration.
- **Comments**: Insert comments into the instrumentation log to provide context for timing data.
- **Logging**: Automatically generate detailed logs with timestamps, execution times, and custom comments.
- **Activation Toggle**: Enable or disable instrumentation without removing method calls.
- **Singleton Design**: Ensures a single instance of the instrumentation class throughout the application.

## Getting Started
To use the Performance Instrumentation Tool, clone this repository and include `Instrumentation.java` in your Java project.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:conboy/performance-instrumentation.git
```
